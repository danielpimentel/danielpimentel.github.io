	  <div class="body"><br>

	    <p>We often want to find a subspace that explains a dataset.
				But often data is missing, so we cannot use our usual tricks, like PCA.
				To build some intuition of the difficulties of this problem,
				suppose I give you one datapoint (no missing data),
				and ask you to find the 1-dimensional subspace <i>S</i> that explains it.
				Easy: it is the subspace going from the origin to the given point.
			</p><br><br>

		  <img class="illustration", style="width:40%",
		       src="Images/subspaceFullData.png"/><br>

		  <p>Now suppose I give you one datapoint <i>without</i> the <i>z</i> coordinate.
				Then we don't even know where the point <i>is</i>, and we can no longer find the
				subspace that explains it.  There are infinitely many options!
			</p><br><br>

			<img class="illustration", style="width:40%",
		       src="Images/subspaceMissingData.png"/><br>

			<p>If I give you an other incomplete point <i>with</i> the <i>(y,z)</i> coordinates,
				then you would be able to find <i>S</i>.  This would <i>not</i> be the case if I
				gave you an other incomplete point <i>without</i> the <i>z</i> coordinate.
			</p>

			<p><b>The question is</b>: if I give you a collection of <i>incomplete</i> points,
				where do I need to observe them such that they uniquely define an <i>r</i>-dimensional
				subspace? Whence, how do I identify such a subspace?
				This has been the main focus of my work.
			</p>

			<p>Collection of <i>incomplete</i> points are usually given in the form of a
				partially observed matrix.  A matrix is rank-<i>r</i> iff all its columns lie in an
				<i>r</i>-dimensional subspace. Hence this problem is usually called Low-Rank Matrix
				Completion (<b>LRMC</b>).	If we knew <i>S</i> we could infer the missing entries.
				Conversely, if we knew the missing entries, we could infer <i>S</i>.
				So this is like a chicken and egg problem.

	    <div class="bigText"> Unions of Subspaces </div>
	  </div>


	  <div class="body"><br>

	    <p>Sometimes we have an incomplete data matrix whose columns lie in a
				union of subspaces. The goal is to infer the underlying subspaces and
				cluster the columns accordingly.
				This is often known as incomplete-data Subspace Clustering (<b>iSC</b>).
			</p><br>

		  <img class="illustration", style="width:75%",
		       src="Images/UoSfig.png"/><br>

		  <p>iSC is the generalization of LRMC to the case where columns lie in several
				subspaces, rather than just one.  Similarly, iSC is the generalization of
				Subspace Clustering to the case where data is incomplete.
				The main question is: <b>when can we hope to solve this problem, and how?</b>

	  </div>


	  <div class="body"><br>

	    <p>One is often given a data matrix whose columns lie in a low-dimensional
				subspace (as in the left), but every column may have a few grossly
				corrupted entries (as in the right).  This makes every point an outlier.
			</p><br><br>

			<img class="illustration", style="width:75%",
		       src="Images/rpca.png"/><br>

			<p>The goal is to identify the underlying subspace.  This problem is often
				known as Robust PCA.
				If columns lie in a union of subspaces, rather than just one, the
				problem is called Robust Subspace Clustering.
